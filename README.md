## Print and Play

This repository's subdirectories contain PDF files with rules and
cards to print and play the game. Different variants of card
sizes are available. To make the cards durable you could laminate
the cards.

* <a href='https://github.com/OMerkel/Scrum-Card-Game/releases'>Get the latest release in English or German!</a>
* Additionally the repository's root holds subdirectories with names reflecting which card size related files can be found in there.

The card designs of the Scrum Card Game are available in PDF and SVG. If you can get blank business cards
available as office supplies then you can print the PDF onto the blank cards.
Another option is to print the cards on normal paper and then cut the cards manually. Heavy
weight paper shall be used for enhanced durability. For better protection the cards could be laminated.
The lamination foil should be non glare if possible and available. In case you plan to create own card
texts or modify the existing ones you should go for an alternative approach like putting the cards into
business card pouches for single cards. The cards are kept in the protecting pouches while playing and
the cards can be easily removed from the pouch as intended, be modified and placed back.

Using card size of standard business cards (85mm x 54mm) will allow to use business card pouches
for card protection. To ease printing and finishing of cards a business card size of
85mm x 54mm is chosen in files of directory named '85x54mm-business card size'.

Instead of searching for business card pouches in office supplies
you could find similar articles in game stores stocking Trading Card
Games (TCGs). TCG players often protect their cards with card
sleeves or card protectors. The ones that match the business cards
in size are called Standard American Board Game Sleeves
(87mm x 56mm, 3-1/2 x 2-1/4 inch).

More common and popular for TCGs is a so called Standard Card Size
(88mm x 63mm, 3-1/2 x 2-1/2 inch) with sleeve protectors a bit
bigger than that (91mm x 66mm). In case you can get these in different
variants then non glare sleeves are recommended.
