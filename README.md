Scrum Card Game: Scrum Sprint Simulation played as a multi-player card game

## Print and Play

This repository's subdirectories contain PDF files with rules and
cards to print and play the game. Variants of card sizes are available
To make the cards durable you could laminate the cards.

Experience showed that the format of 8 cards per sheet is a
disadvantage in case temporary modifications or experimental
changes should be done to the card text or data.

To ease printing and finishing of cards a business card size of
85mm x 54mm is chosen in files of directory named
'business card size-85x54mm'. Typically this size offers to print
10 cards per sheet. This is an international standard size for
business cards so that any standard business card box can be used
to store the cards. Standard business card pouches (one card per
transparent pouch) can be found for making the print-and-play game
material durable without dealing to laminate each card. Fast
exchange or introduction of new cards is possible this way.
As another option TCGs (Trading Card Games) often come in card
size with sleeves or deck protectors of 2-1/4 x 3-1/2 inch
( 57mm x 88mm sleeves ) that could be used to protect the cards.

The cards are provided in editable form as a LibreOffice Impress
document. The printed cards need to be cut when using normal paper.
Alternatively you will be able to get blank business cards sheets to
print on. Mind that some blank business cards are available that
can easily be separated from the print sheet and then have absolutely
smooth edges. Such that the game card quality and finish is very
high.
